# Blanche Dissections

A toolkit for exploring dissections into non-congruent equal-area rectangles (**Blanche dissections**). This includes:

1. A command-line tool to enumerate all such dissections of a square with a given number of rectangles, yielding exact algebraic descriptions of the rectangle dimensions rather than numeric approximations.
2. A visualization tool to render images of these dissections from the algebraic data.
